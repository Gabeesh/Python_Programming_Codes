'''
Python was conceived in the late 1980s[25] and its implementation was started in December 1989[26] by Guido van Rossum
at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL)[27] capable of exception handling and interfacing
 with the Amoeba operating system.[5] Van Rossum is Python's principal author,
 and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community,
 benevolent dictator for life.
