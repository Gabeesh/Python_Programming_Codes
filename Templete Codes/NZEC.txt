One thing to note: 
Input:
30 120.00

Output:
89.50

In input two values are on same line and the way your code receives input is wrong, it will work only for newline input.
So if you want to take multiple input from single line use map().
Here is an example:
Replace these two lines
t=float(raw_input())
s=float(raw_input())
with

t,s=map(float, raw_input().split())

And your code will be able to receive multiple input from single line..!!
